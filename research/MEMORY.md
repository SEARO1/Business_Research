## Findings (detailed)

### 1. Vendor security review consumes 5,000+ hours/year
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Enterprise vendor security review is 100 hours per vendor,
  repeated across 50+ vendors annually (5,000+ hrs/year total). The
  same security questionnaires are answered repeatedly with no shared
  industry response.
- **Source:** https://www.vanta.com/customers (George Uzzle, CISO,
  Vibrent Health ??quoted on Vanta's customer page).
- **Severity:** High. Security review backlog blocks enterprise sales;
  engineering/security staff diverted to questionnaire responses.

### 2. Security review adds 3-4 weeks to sales cycles
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Security review process adds 3-4 weeks to enterprise
  sales cycles. Customers demand full security questionnaires before
  signing.
- **Source:** https://www.vanta.com/customers (Paul Yoo, Head of
  Platform Security, DocGo).
- **Severity:** High. Direct revenue impact.

### 3. Manual compliance labor = 2,000+ hours/year
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Manual compliance labor consumes 2,000+ hours per year
  at major enterprises. Point-in-time checks for SOC 2/ISO audits,
  evidence collection, framework maintenance are the largest sinks.
- **Source:** https://www.vanta.com/customers (Megan Snyder, Director
  Customer Assurance, Snowflake).
- **Severity:** Critical. FTE-level drain; mid-size must hire staff
  or pay $100K+ consultants.

### 4. 2 GRC employees maintaining 12+ frameworks
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** 2 full-time GRC employees maintaining 12+ frameworks
  (PCI-DSS, FedRAMP, HIPAA, ISO 27001/27017/27018, NIST CSF, etc.).
  New framework onboarding = manual download ??review ??spreadsheet
  conversion ??gap analysis.
- **Source:** https://www.vanta.com/customers/ramp
- **Severity:** Critical. Linear team/framework mismatch.

### 5. GRC = 10+ disconnected spreadsheets
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** GRC work done in 10+ disconnected spreadsheets per
  framework/regulation. Cross-framework control mapping is manual.
- **Source:** https://www.vanta.com/customers/ramp
- **Severity:** High. Audit prep = manual reconciliation.

### 6. Global compliance: 40 currencies ? 195 countries
- **Category:** Security
- **Friction:** Financial platform operating in 40 currencies / 195
  countries must comply with framework requirements in each
  jurisdiction; teams can't scale headcount linearly with country
  count.
- **Source:** https://www.vanta.com/customers/ramp
- **Severity:** High. Country count > team count = posture gaps.

### 7. 76-country tool silos block global visibility
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Years of accumulated tool silos from local team
  autonomy. At 160,000-employee Saint-Gobain (76 countries), created
  "disjointed data models, and point-to-point integrations" that
  hampered real-time visibility.
- **Source:** https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/saint-gobain-manufacturing
- **Severity:** Critical. Forced multi-year, multi-million-dollar SAP
  S/4HANA migration (started ~2025, completing 2029).

### 8. Batch-level traceability impossible in silos
- **Category:** Security
- **Friction:** Environmental regulations (EU CSRD) require
  product-level CO2, recyclability, water consumption data. Impossible
  when product data lives in 76-country silos.
- **Source:** https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/saint-gobain-manufacturing
- **Severity:** Critical. New regulations cannot be met.

### 9. Cloud + on-prem + OT integration gap
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Enterprise integration must span cloud + on-prem +
  operational technology (OT) behind firewalls (SCADA, MES, WMS).
  Generic iPaaS tools fail on OT environments.
- **Source:** https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/saint-gobain-manufacturing
- **Severity:** High. OT is the slow lane of "digital transformation."

### 10. API reusability only 35% initially
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Initial API reusability was 35% at Saint-Gobain; took
  12+ months of focused "Center for Enablement" work to lift to 57%.
  Without reusability, every new region = new integration project.
- **Source:** https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/saint-gobain-manufacturing
- **Severity:** High. Hidden tax on enterprise integration.

### 11. ~100 on-prem AD servers
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Hitachi ran nearly 100 Active Directory authentication
  servers on-premise, each requiring patching, replication, DR config.
- **Source:** https://www.okta.com/customers/hitachi/
- **Severity:** High. Ops overhead + per-server breach vector.

### 12. M&A identity integration = 6 months per acquisition
- **Category:** Security
- **Friction:** On-premise identity integration "can take six months
  just to pull the network" per acquired company. With many
  simultaneous M&As, becomes a multi-year, multi-million-dollar
  effort.
- **Source:** https://www.okta.com/customers/hitachi/
- **Severity:** Critical. M&A synergy realization is gated on identity.

### 13. 480k identity inventory impossible manually
- **Category:** Security
- **Friction:** At 480,000 identities, "it was not practical to check
  the usage status of each and every one" manually. Unused
  identities are the top attack vector; manual governance creates
  systematic security debt.
- **Source:** https://www.okta.com/customers/hitachi/
- **Severity:** High. Zero Trust adoption requires identity
  inventory at scale.

### 14. Hub-and-spoke IT fails on time zones & M&A systems
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Central IT "faces issues such as the inability to
  respond to local requests in a timely manner" due to time-zone
  gaps; M&A-acquired entities bring independent systems that don't
  fit the central model.
- **Source:** https://www.okta.com/customers/hitachi/
- **Severity:** High. Centralization vs. local agility trade-off.

### 15. Carbon-neutrality constrains IT procurement
- **Category:** Security
- **Friction:** Hitachi's IT Strategy & Digital Integration Division
  "selects products with carbon neutrality in mind" ??sustainability
  is now an IT procurement constraint. On-prem AD servers (~100) carry
  carbon-footprint liability.
- **Source:** https://www.okta.com/customers/hitachi/
- **Severity:** Medium. New decision dimension that traditional IT
  evaluation frameworks don't capture.

### 16. In-house identity needs 8-10 FTE
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Homegrown identity solutions require multi-team
  ongoing maintenance ("a couple of teams" to keep it "always secure,
  patched, and up to date"). Estimated cost: **8-10 dedicated
  security experts and developers**.
- **Source:** https://auth0.com/case-studies/dunelm
- **Severity:** High. Hidden FTE tax of 8-10 employees just to
  maintain identity infrastructure.
- Source: Antony Sohal, Head of Data Platforms, Dunelm.

### 17. Legacy identity blocks integration at 200+ NHS trusts
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Legacy apps without industry auth standards cannot
  integrate with 200+ downstream trusts' varied identity systems.
  NHS Leadership Academy's old system "didn't follow any of the
  industry authentication and authorization standards" and was
  "tough to integrate."
- **Source:** https://auth0.com/case-studies/nhs-leadership-academy
- **Severity:** Critical for regulated, multi-stakeholder orgs. SSO
  absence forces per-trust bespoke integration.
- Source: Ishani Vardhan, Digital Delivery Lead, NHS Leadership Academy.

### 18. 5-month procurement cycles in public sector
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Public-sector procurement for new identity vendors
  takes 5+ months. "Formal business case" required "user stories and
  cost-benefit analyses showing what we'd do with the product."
- **Source:** https://auth0.com/case-studies/nhs-leadership-academy
- **Severity:** High. Time-to-value dominated by procurement, not
  technical onboarding.
- Source: Ishani Vardhan, Digital Delivery Lead, NHS Leadership Academy.

### 19. Identity must span B2B / B2E / B2C / M2M
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Identity must serve multiple audiences with separate
  requirements: B2B (external suppliers), B2E (internal staff +
  ADFS), B2C (customer checkout), M2M (microservice auth). Dunelm
  has "in the millions" of M2M connections alone.
- **Source:** https://auth0.com/case-studies/dunelm
- **Severity:** High. Single product that can't span all four
  forces 2-4 separate identity systems per org.
- Source: Antony Sohal, Head of Data Platforms, Dunelm.

### 20. Vendor API rate limits surface at runtime without warning
- **Category:** Security
- **Friction:** Vendor API rate limits surface at runtime without
  warning, forcing mid-production incident response. GrandVision
  "encountered an API limit that they were previously unaware of"
  and needed vendor support to resolve in hours.
- **Source:** https://auth0.com/case-studies/grandvision
- **Severity:** Medium. Unannounced rate limits can cause
  customer-facing outages misattributed to buyer's implementation.
- Source: Kunal Chakraborty, Global VP Customer Experience & Digital,
  GrandVision.

## Research Session Notes

### 2026-06-05 ??Branch `research/pain-points-v1` ??**COMPLETE (Mode A)**
- Initial setup: scaffolded `research/` dir with `MEMORY.md` and
  `research_log.jsonl` schema.
- Scope: global digital services, B2B / enterprise / developer focus.
- **Iteration count:** 3 vendor families (Vanta, MuleSoft, Okta).
- **Findings logged:** 15 distinct pain points, all from
  named-customer, named-executive, quantified sources.
- Supplanted by Mode B switch on 2026-06-05.

### 2026-06-05 ??Branch `research/auth0-identity-v1` ??**Mode B**
- **Mode:** B (autonomous evaluation) ??first session under the new
  operating mode.
- **Vendor family:** Auth0 (Okta Customer Identity / CIAM).
- **Customer case studies:** Dunelm, NHS Leadership Academy, GrandVision.
- **Findings logged:** 5 (numbered 16??0).
- **Skipped vendors in this iteration:** Stripe (marketing page lacked
  pain-before-vendor patterns); Drata (Cloudflare block); Workato
  (404 on case study URL patterns). Logged to saturation heuristics.
- **Search quality notes:**
  - Auth0 case studies are written as **`.md` raw markdown** at
    predictable paths (`auth0.com/case-studies/<name>.md`). This is
    a great target shape.
  - Skipped vendors are valuable negative data ??they tell us where
    not to spend time.

### Saturation note
Session 1 yielded 15/15 high-quality findings from 3 vendors (avg 5/session).
Session 2 yielded 5/5 from 1 vendor (Auth0). Stripe yielded 0/5
(marketing page, no pain-before patterns). Drata & Workato were
unreachable (Cloudflare + 404). The diminishing-returns threshold
(>2 vendors yielding <3 findings) has not yet tripped, but I'm
watching it.

### 21. Tool sprawl kills roadmap visibility
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Engineering + product + design + ops teams on
  disconnected tools (Jira + Atlas + Monday.com + spreadsheets) with
  no single source of truth. "Navigating a maze of threads, channels,
  tickets, different tools."
- **Source:** https://linear.app/customers/brex
- **Severity:** High. Tool sprawl directly undermines velocity.
- Source: James Reggio, CTO, Brex.

### 22. PM tools prioritize reporting over creation
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Most PM tools are designed for managers, not engineers.
  "They prioritize reporting over creation, burdening engineers with
  slow interfaces and mandatory fields."
- **Source:** https://linear.app/customers/brex
- **Severity:** High. Tools engineers don't enjoy aren't kept
  up to date, which destroys the data managers need.
- Source: James Reggio, CTO, Brex.

### 23. Pilot-driven, metrics-based procurement
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Pilot-driven, metrics-based procurement is the new
  enterprise norm. Brex ran a 4-month pilot with baseline + post
  surveys across 6 dimensions. Improvements: 26%-63% per dimension.
- **Source:** https://linear.app/customers/brex
- **Severity:** Critical for vendors. Sales cycle now requires
  3-6 month pilot with measurable before/after.
- Source: Robert Kim, Engineering Manager, Brex.

### 24. Engineering tools need UX, not mandates
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Engineering tools with slow / painful UX fail to
  gain adoption even when mandated top-down. Brex pilot success
  metric was "engineers enjoyed using it" ¡X 47% increase in daily
  usage, 63% increase in satisfaction.
- **Source:** https://linear.app/customers/brex
- **Severity:** High. Top-down mandates without engineer buy-in
  create shadow IT.
- Source: James Reggio, CTO, Brex.

### 25. Ticket backlogs grow without triage/ownership
- **Category:** Integration
- **Friction:** Engineering ticket backlogs grow without
  triage/ownership, leading to issues that "get lost in the ether"
  instead of being worked. Scale AI had 3 independent teams attempt
  to switch tools before org-wide momentum, indicating pre-pilot
  fragmentation.
- **Source:** https://linear.app/customers/scale
- **Severity:** High. Without rotation/scheduled ownership, every
  team has orphaned tickets.
- Source: Sam Sipe, Head of Engineering Public Sector, Scale AI.

### 26. Bottom-up adoption beats top-down for engineering tools
- **Category:** Onboarding
- **Friction:** Bottom-up adoption beats top-down procurement for
  engineering tools. Scale AI "planned for 50 seats initially, but
  suddenly, hundreds more signed up" after 3 teams independently
  adopted Linear.
- **Source:** https://linear.app/customers/scale
- **Severity:** High. Engineering teams will adopt tools that
  solve their pain without IT/management sign-off; vendors who can
  land one team get free expansion.
- Source: Clemens Viernickel, Staff Product Manager, Scale AI.

### 2026-06-05 ¡X Branch `research/notion-enterprise-v1` ¡X **Mode B session 4**
- **Mode:** B (autonomous evaluation).
- **Vendor family:** Notion (enterprise workspace).
- **Customer case study:** Ramp (consolidation + AI operating
  system for work).
- **Findings logged:** 6 (numbered 27¡V32).
- **Search quality notes:**
  - Notion's customer URLs follow `/customers/<slug>` (same shape
    as Linear). Working shape confirmed.
  - Ramp's case is unusually rich: a year-long narrative
    (mid-2024 ¡÷ mid-2025 ¡÷ forward) with named execs, quantified
    outcomes, and a clear "before vs. after" arc.
  - Six findings extracted from a single case study. Other Notion
    case studies (Vercel, Braintrust, Equals Money) likely yield
    another 10-15 findings, so Notion alone could fuel 2-3 more
    sessions.
